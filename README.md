# Walk-a-paw

1. Create another website (the topic is up to you, but it must be different than your previous project topic) using HTML, CSS, JS, and NODE. (fully commented - where appropriate)

2. You must write a white paper explaining the concept/design/business-model behind your website, and at least 5 salient points from the code (including what challenges you encountered and how you solved the problems).

3. The website will be local and have at least 4 pages to it that are linked via hyperlinks.

4. The code must include your own JS idea implemented, as well as at least five (6) different project/concept ideas from the udemy course (section 15 and on).

5. There must be a place to input information and have it stored (written to either a database or a file).

6. You must use NODE to set up an HTTP connection and take care to account for potential bugs/errors/etc.  You should render local, showing the connection. Make sure to identify and explain in the video.

7. You need to create a video explaining what you wrote in the white paper in your own words, and showing that your files run properly with intended functionality.

8. You can work in alone or in groups (up to five people) - only one person from the group needs to submit

9. Include a github link with the submission.

10. All the names of the people in your group must appear on the website
